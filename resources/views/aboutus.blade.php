                        Jaffna teaching hospital is the tertiary centre for the Northern Province which encompasses
                        five districts - Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya.It caters for a population of 1.2 million.
                        The population is likely to rise as significant numbers of displaced are expected to return to their homeland with the onset of peace and stability.
                        Some patients from the eastern province also seek cardiac interventional treatment in Jaffna rather than in Kandy or Colombo because of language and social contacts.

                        We believe that the cardiac disease burden in the northern district is
                        higher than the rest of Sri Lanka. The northern region has undergone a
                        demographic change due to the migration of the younger generation and the
                        age distribution of the population has become skewed. Thus the need for
                        cardiovascular care, particularly the need for coronary intervention has
                        increased. Secondly unlike in other parts of SriLanka, the incidence of
                        rheumatic heart disease has not declined because of continuing poor socioeconomic
                        conditions. Therefore the prevalence of valve problems remains high.

                        At present the cardiology unit of the teaching hospital, Jaffna does not
                        offer cardiac surgery for its patients for lack of infrastructure and manpower.
                        However the unit has expanded significantly in its services since its inception
                        in 2005. Starting with a 5 bed CCU and an echo machine and a single cardiologist
                        (Dr S Manoharan) with 3 medical officers. Paediatric Cardiology service is available from 2011.

                        Now our unit has expanded to an almost fully fledged cardiac unit with 3 cardiologists
                        including two Adult Cardiologists and a Paediatric cardiologist and offering coronary
                        and congenital cardiac interventions to its patients. Patients from Kilinochi, Mannar,
                        Mullaitivu and Vavuniya visit our echo lab almost daily and patients from as far as Ampara
                        have undergone coronary angiogram and PCI in our cath lab.
